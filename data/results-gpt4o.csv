"To calculate the percentage increase in cash and cash equivalents for AVGO from October 30, 2022, to October 29, 2023:

1. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 30, 2022 (calculated by subtracting the increase from the amount as of October 29, 2023): 
   - $14,189 million (as of October 29, 2023) - $1,773 million (increase) = $12,416 million (as of October 30, 2022).

2. The percentage increase is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. Plugging in the values:

- Diluted EPS for fiscal 2021: $16.69 - $1.16 (increase) = $15.53
- Diluted EPS for fiscal 2022: $16.69

Now, the percentage increase can be calculated as follows:

Percentage increase = [(EPS in fiscal 2022 - EPS in fiscal 2021) / EPS in fiscal 2021] x 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Percentage increase = [($16.69 - $15.53) / $15.53] x 100
Percentage increase = [$1.16 / $15.53] x 100

"The financial value of a patent for GILD in relation to product market approval can be impacted by several factors:

1. **Timing of the Patent**: If the patent is obtained long before the marketing approval of the product, its commercial value may be limited.

2. **Patent Term Extensions**: Delays in obtaining marketing approval can also affect the financial value. Companies can apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates to extend the patent term, which helps compensate for these delays and may enhance the patent's value.

3. **Market Pressures**: Once the product is approved, external pressures from private insurers and government payers can lead to reductions in net product prices, potentially impacting the expected financial returns associated with the patent.

4. **Patent Quality**: Ensuring that the patent is properly drafted and enforceable can increase its competitive value, making it harder for competitors to create similar products that could diminish the financial returns from the patented technology.","The commercial value of a patent can be limited if the patent is obtained long before the marketing approval of the product, as the patent term starts from the date of filing the patent application, which might precede regulatory approval and commercial sales.",a377fd9f,What factors can impact the financial value of a patent for GILD in regards to product market approval?,GILD
